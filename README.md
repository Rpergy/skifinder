# skifinder
  While planning routes for my family while skiing in Vail, I thought it would be cool to create an application that can automatically do this. My end goal was to be able to select a starting and ending point, and the program would tell you the shortest path between the two. 
  This project uses graph traversal and Dijkstra's Algorithm (https://brilliant.org/wiki/dijkstras-short-path-finder/) in order to find the shorest path. Every ski map is represented as a graph of verticies, all connected by edges. I have written a tool with Pygame that helps me easily create maps for different ski resorts. 
  
  Eventually, I'd like to turn this project into a full-fledged app that someone could use for themselves while skiing.
